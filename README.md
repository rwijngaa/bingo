# bingo

Play a game of Bingo on the Arduino and a 16x2 LCD.

Press the button and a random number between 1 and 75
will be drawn and displayed on the LCD. The letter B,I,N,G or O
is also displayed based on the number drawn. Duplicates are taken 
care of. To get a 'real' random number the Entropy library is used:

Tested on Arduino Uno.
Lcd: for example https://www.adafruit.com/products/399

 
Happy playing
